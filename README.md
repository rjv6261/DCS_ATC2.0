# DCS_ATC 2.0
A mod for the popular game DCS. This will hopefully work to slowly improve and upgrade their ATC system. As of right now, I am still working on it and trying to get it implemented, bear with me and if you feel that you can help, add me on discord @spicy2160

Plans right now are rough but are below

Update Alpha 1.0
- A working system (separate or connected to DCS' ATC), that will at least respond to you when you contact on the radio system
-Taxi and parking for after you land

Update Alpha 1.1
-Different menus that are similar to BMS, allowing the user to dictate Start-up, Taxi, Takeoff, Landing , parking (or maybe I will dictate it based on state)
